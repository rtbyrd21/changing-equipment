				"1850s" : {
					"description" : ["Iron plows pulled by horses or oxen were typical in the early days of the county. Plowing land near groves of trees was relatively easy, but the prairie had dense root systems that made plowing incredibly difficult. Until steel plows (like the one shown here) were available in McLean County, farmers had to deal with soil sticking to the plows and not turning over."]
				},
				"1920s" : {
					"description" : ["Gang plows (implements with more than one plow) turned over more soil in one pass than a single plow. Gang plows had to be pulled by multiple horses, or a tractor.", "Tractors began to become affordable for area farmers by 1925. Early tractors had metal wheels, but in the 1930s rubber tires were becoming more common. Tractors greatly improved farmers’ efficiency in the fields."]
				},
				"1950s" : {
					"description" : ["Tractor technology improved dramatically after World War II. They were faster and more powerful, which allowed heavier equipment to be used.  This John Deere 5020 tractor could travel at five or six miles per hour."]
				},
				"2010s" : {
					"description" : ["In the 1980s plows were replaced by tools, like discs and chisels, which helped conserve the soil by not turning it over—therefore decreasing the chance of erosion.", "Disks cut crop residue, and spring shanks loosened the soil beneath the surface.", "Sometimes a harrow was dragged behind the disks to level out the soil."]
				}
			},

			"planting" : {
				"1850s" : {
					"description" : ["Early corn planters saved the farmers backs from constantly bending over to plant seeds with small tools or by hand. This video shows a two-row planter. Many farmers had a similar device that only planted one row at a time. One-row planters first became available to McLean County farmers in the 1850s."]
				},
				"1920s" : {
					"description" : ["In the 1860s many McLean County farmers invested in equipment they could ride.", "The planter shown here is two-row check-row planter. Check-row planters guaranteed that seeds were evenly spaced within and between rows. Check-row planters were used for almost 100 years in McLean County."]
				},
				"1950s" : {
					"description" : ["By the 1960s the check-row era was over. Planters were pulled by tractors with rubber tires, which enabled the farmers to plant more acres with less labor. Rather than a guide wire, farmers used a “marker” that was dragged over the soil next to the planter to guide their planting. By that time herbicides and mechanical cultivators could better control weeds in fields, so farmers could plant more seeds closer together within rows."]
				},
				"2010s" : {
					"description" : ["In the 1970s technology improved such that planting was done simultaneously with some tillage and fertilizing. Combining these tasks meant farmers could do double or triple the work with only one pass through the field.", "In the 2010s multitasking implements became essential for farmers to make a profit on their farms. The planter shown here not only applied fertilizer at the same time as planting, but it also planted seeds at extremely precise intervals and depths, and could adjust seed output based on previous years’ yields. All the planting data (such as the number of seeds per acre) appeared on a monitor in the cab of the tractor."]
				}

			"cultivating" : {
				"1830s" : {
					"description" : ["Hoes have been used for centuries. Native people in Illinois used hoes made of stone, shells, and the shoulder blades of bison to cultivate fields.", "Early McLean County settlers used iron hoes in their fields until horse drawn cultivators became more widely available on the frontier."]
				},
				"1860s" : {
					"description" : ["The arrival of the railroad brought new technology and goods for all aspects of life, including farming. Horse drawn cultivators made the difficult task of weeding easier, but farmers still had to go through their fields with a hoe and remove weeds that the cultivator missed."]
				},
				"1950s" : {
					"description" : ["After World War II herbicides were readily available and affordable for farmers. Herbicides didn’t control all of the weeds, though. Cultivators pulled by tractors (like the one shown here) helped farmers keep their fields free from weeds after crops were planted."]
				},
				"2010s" : {
					"description" : ["By the 2010s, mechanical cultivating was replaced by chemical sprays. Often farmers sprayed fields with weed control chemicals before planting or before seeds germinated, and sprayed again to rescue fields from remaining weeds after crops began to grow."]
				}
			},

			"harvesting" : {
				"1830s" : {
					"description" : ["Harvesting a corn crop was a laborious task. Farmers had to cut the stalks, bind them, and stack them into shocks. Later they removed the ears of corn as needed and shelled them. One farmer could not accomplish this by themselves. Farmers hired help and enlisted the help of their children. Some farmers continued to manually harvest their crops into the 1930s."]
				},
				"1860s" : {
					"description" : ["Corn cutters and binders helped farmers in McLean County get the corn stalks out of the field in a timely manner. The implement shown here is cutting the corn plants while they are still green, which means the stalk and ears would have been chopped into silage and eventually fed to livestock.", "Equipment that cut and bound the stalks together allowed the farmer to store dried stalks in the field and remove the ears of corn at a later date.   (see top of next page)"]
				},
				"1950s" : {
					"description" : ["By the 1950s many farmers were using self-propelled corn pickers to remove the ears of corn from the stalks. Later, motorized corn shellers separated the kernels from the cob. Shown here is a Massey-Harris corn picker, with ear corn falling into a wagon."]
				},
				"2010s" : {
					"description" : ["McLean County farmer Robert Hartzold put it best when he said, “We [harvest] more corn today in one day than we used to plant in a whole season.” Early twenty-first century, high-tech combines picked, shucked, shelled, and shredded stalks of field corn in one pass. Kernels were then transferred to a grain cart or truck, and then transported to on-farm storage or an elevator."]
